# TrafficVisualizer

### Display and view traffic congestion and incidents with HERE maps.
<br>
The maps offered by the HERE API show 3 color coded levels of congestion 

- Green > Flowing traffic
- Yellow > Moderate traffic
- Red > Heavy congestion
<br>
Included on the map are icons indicating certain traffic events.
<br>
The map offers 3D interactivity - see this article for reference: https://developer.here.com/blog/announcing-the-new-javascript-api-3.1

On desktop - use the `alt` or `option` key while using the mouse to move the map view around.
On mobile - the same can be achieved by using two fingers on the map and moving them up or down to change the view.
